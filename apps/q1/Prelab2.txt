32 semaphores and 64 locks are available in DLXOS

System calls are: LockCreate(), LockHandleAcquire() and LockHandleRelease()

In dointerrupt, SemCreate is used to create a semaphore. All 
semaphores are defined in a semaphore array, and SemCreate
function loops through the array to find unused semaphore. If
a semaphore is available, its waiting queue will be 
instantiated by SemInit function.
